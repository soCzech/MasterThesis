# Deep Learning-Based Approaches for Shot Transition Detection and Known-Item Search in Video


This repository contains LaTeX source codes of my master thesis *Deep Learning-Based Approaches for Shot Transition Detection and Known-Item Search in Video* oficially available in [Charles University Digital repository (dspace.cuni.cz)](https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/121024).


Part of the work is presented in the following papers but the thesis contains further evaluations, ablation studies and implementation details:

### :floppy_disk: Experimets

The source code for the first part of the thesis regarding shot transition detection model TransNetV2 is available [here :octocat:](https://github.com/soCzech/TransNetV2).

The source code for the sencond part of the thesis regarding text retrieval model W2VV++BERT is available [here :octocat:](https://github.com/soCzech/w2vvpp_bert).


### :closed_book:	LaTeX Compilation

The source code can be compiled into PDF file using pdfLaTex by running `pdflatex thesis.tex; bibtex thesis.aux; pdflatex thesis.tex; pdflatex thesis.tex` from `src` directory or importing it into [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). The compiled PDF file is available in this repository as [Thesis.pdf](https://github.com/soCzech/MasterThesis/blob/main/Thesis.pdf) or in [Charles University Digital repository](https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/121024).
